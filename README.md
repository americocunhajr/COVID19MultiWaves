**HarvesterOpt - Harvester Optimizer** is an easy-to-run code to solve an optimization problem to maximize the energy recovered by a bistable piezo-magneto-elastic energy harvesting system. The implementation follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive. 

This package includes the following files:
